// Most of these are required as globals and a few of them are actually gems that
// don't seem to work very well with npm-based build pipelines. For example, `dropzone`
// doesn't seem to have the compiled versions and attempts to require `./lib/dropzone.js`
// but the npm package only has `src/dropzone.coffee`.
