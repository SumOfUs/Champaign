# MemberAuthentication contains a member's authentication tokens
# for all providers:
#
# If the user decided to create a password (instead of using social login),
# we will store their hashed password here (using `has_secure_password`).
# To authentiacate: `member_authentication.try(:authenticate, 'password')`
#   - password_digest
#
# If the user signed up with Facebook, we store some important information
# in order to authenticate them later on:
#   - facebook_uid
#   - facebook_token
#   - facebook_expiry
#
# NOTE: Users that sign up with facebook will have a random password generated
# for them. This is to satisfy `has_secure_password` validations, and for as an
# added security measure.
