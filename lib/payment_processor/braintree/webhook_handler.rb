      # This class serves to record data passed in by Braintree's webhook service.
      # Currently, this just means that when a subscription is charged, it will create
      # a Payment::BraintreeTransaction and push the original action to the Queue.
      #
      # == Usage
      #
      # Call <tt>PaymentProcessor::Clients::Braintree::WebhookHandler.handle</tt>
      #
      # === Options
      #
      # * +:notification+    - Braintree::Notification object. only those of kind 'subscription_charged_successfully'
      #                        will be processed. All others will simply be logged to the Rails logger.l)
