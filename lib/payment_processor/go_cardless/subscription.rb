      #
      # Wrapper around GoCardless's Ruby SDK. This class essentially just stuffs parameters
      # into the keys that are expected by GoCardless's class. Most of the good stuff happens
      # in the Populator class, which is inherited by this and Transaction.
      #
      # == Usage
      #
      # Call <tt>PaymentProcessor::Clients::GoCardless::Subscription.make_subscription</tt>
