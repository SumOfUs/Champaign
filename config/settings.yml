# This is the central repository for settings in Champaign. Settings are defined in the following files:
#
#    config/settings.yml
#    config/settings/#{environment}.yml
#    config/environments/#{environment}.yml
#
#    config/settings.local.yml
#    config/settings/#{environment}.local.yml
#    config/environments/#{environment}.local.yml
#
# Settings defined in files lower on the list override settings higher on the list. So, settings in
# config/settings/#{environment}.yml will override the settings in this file, and settings in
# config/settings/#{environment}.local.yml will override the settings in that file.

# General Champaign settings.
     secret_key_base: 'Set this in settings.local.yml or in an environment settings file.'
     omniauth_client_secret: 'Set this in settings.local.yml or in an environment settings file.'
     omniauth_client_id: 'Set this in settings.local.yml or in an environment settings file.'

# AWS Config Variables. These Variables will cause Champaign to attempt to send background processing information, like
# page creation/update information or page signature events to a background processor listening on the specified
# queue. Only set these settings to values if you want Champaign to take these actions. Disabled by default, except
# in production situations.
#    aws_access_key_id: ‘get from https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#users’

#    ak_password: 'Just like ak_username.'


# CloudFront config Variables. These variables are used to configure static asset serving via cloudfront, a CDN. Disabled
# by default in development, they should be overridden in production settings to speed up Champaign's page performance.

#    fog_directory: 'get this from cloudfront configuration'
#    rails_serve_static_files: 'Set to nil in development, override for production server based on needs.'
