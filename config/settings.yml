# This is the central repository for settings in Champaign. Settings are defined in the following files:
#
#    config/settings.yml
#    config/settings/#{environment}.yml
#    config/environments/#{environment}.yml
#
#    config/settings.local.yml
#    config/settings/#{environment}.local.yml
#    config/environments/#{environment}.local.yml
#
# Settings defined in files lower on the list override settings higher on the list. So, settings in
# config/settings/#{environment}.yml will override the settings in this file, and settings in
# config/settings/#{environment}.local.yml will override the settings in that file.

# General Champaign settings.

# queue. Only set these settings to values if you want Champaign to take these actions. Disabled by default, except
# in production situations.

# by default in development, they should be overridden in production settings to speed up Champaign's page performance.
