    <div class="ups-sub-text">
      We are going to remove popular, political, and economic support for Trump's corporate agenda -- stopping it in its tracks. And we’re going to do it by growing our movement.

      From the  Civil Rights Movement to the Arab Spring to the Colour revolutions, popular movements have proven their effectiveness.

    <div class="ups-number-panel__text">Political scientist Erica Chenoweth found that no movement with active participation of 3.5% of the population involved has ever failed. Which means our target is 11 million.</div>

      <div class="ups-stories__text">
        <strong>Organize locally</strong>

        <strong>Mobilize massively</strong>

      <strong>And we’ll support you every step of the way</strong>
