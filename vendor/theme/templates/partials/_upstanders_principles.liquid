      These are the core principles of being an Upstander:
    </div>
    <ul class="ups-list-panel__list">
      <li class="odd">We stand for a future where all of us can thrive; we stand up for one another against Trump’s corporate coup.</li>
      <li>We are greater than the sum of our parts - if you see a campaign or opportunity to fight corporate power share it here; our movement is full of leaders.</li>
      <li class="odd">We support and respect each other.</li>
      <li>We believe the more people who stand with us, the more powerful we are.</li>
      <li class="odd">It doesn’t matter if you’re new or experienced in standing up against injustice -- what matters most is that you are here now.</li>
      <li>We build community. Everyone has a role to play in putting people and planet over profit.</li>
      <li class="odd">We each have a lot to learn from one another, especially across differences. We can all learn from one another, we support each others learning with compassion no matter where we are on our journey.</li>
      <li>Our movement is a nonviolent one.</li>
      <li class="odd">We center the struggles and stories of those most affected by Trump’s corporate coup.</li>
