      <h1>Upstanders is a new project of SumOfUs.</h1>
      <p>SumOfUs is a community of people from around the world committed to curbing the growing power of corporations. Since 2011 we have supported everyday people to stand up against corporate power and win.</p>
      <p>The election of Donald Trump has ushered in a new era of blatant corporate control of our democracy and it’s putting our families, communities and planet risk. We had no choice but to something about it.</p>
      <p>We decided to build on our years of reigning in corporate power to rise to the challenge and take a stand against Trump’s corporate agenda -- so we created the Upstander movement.</p>
      <p>With the Upstanders movement, SumOfUs is engaging our membership like never before. For the first time, we're sharing our expertise to help our millions of members connect in-person, run winning campaigns in their communities, and mobilize from the grassroots. Together we will end Trump’s corporate coup, reclaim our power, and stand up for the world we all deserve.</p>
